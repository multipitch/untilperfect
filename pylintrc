# Disabled indentation check as this is incorrectly flagging
# indentation that has been properly formatted with `black`.

[BASIC]
# Due to the length of some mathematical formulae, some terse variable
# names are required. Rather than disabling name checkes, these have 
# been explicitly whitelisted.
# TODO: Where the variable name doesn't represent a single-letter
# mathematical variable name, consider replacing with something more 
# verbose.

[TYPECHECK]
# Due to the way matplotlib creates colormaps, these fall afoul of 
# E1101 (no-member).
